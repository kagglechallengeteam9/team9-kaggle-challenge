In this project, we explored the challenge of predicting passenger transportation on the Spaceship Titanic.
Through data preprocessing and modeling, including feature engineering,Machine learning models and ensemble techniques, we achieved robust
predictive models. Critical analysis of our methods and results highlighted insights into feature importance and model performance.

Moving forward, opportunities include refining predictive models with advanced techniques and incorporating
Explainable for deeper insights. This project highlights the importance of methodological accuracy and collaborative
teamwork in data science activities, preparing us for future challenges in predictive modeling and analysis.
